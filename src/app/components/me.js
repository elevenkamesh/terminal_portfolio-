      My name is Palani Kameshwaran, but most people call me Kamesh.<br/> I've always had a deep fascination with technology. My journey began in childhood when I repaired my grandmother's phone and continued through my school years,<br/> fixing my own PC and helping friends with theirs for free. This early exposure to troubleshooting and repairing computers led me to start a small business, charging for my repair services, which further fueled my passion for systems and gaming.

      My interest in tech expanded when I began building gaming PCs for others, merging my love for gaming and hardware. This passion drove me to think bigger, focusing on scalable and high-availability systems and servers. In college, I delved deeper into these areas, engaging with the college networks and servers. I loved discussing servers with Dinesh, the computer lab assistant, which further enhanced my understanding and enthusiasm for building and maintaining robust systems.

      Additionally, I developed an interest in cloud technology and pursued a free AWS course offered by a tech-focused YouTube channel. This has broadened my knowledge in cloud computing, allowing me to explore new possibilities in the tech field. Alongside this, I do some freelancing in video editing, combining my technical skills with creativity.

      Before college started, my friend Shanmuga Perumal taught us Java, which laid a strong foundation for my programming skills. I then self-taught myself React and JavaScript, and fell in love with JavaScript thanks to Akshay Saini. This led me to create some cool web apps, further deepening my passion for Tech.
